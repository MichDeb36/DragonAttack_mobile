Hey, Thanks for checking our models!

Material is using one texture. We do not provide vertex color shader:
Tested on shader provided by Unity Forum user 'defaxer'. You can find the full thread and shader over here ->
https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/standard-shader-with-vertex-colors.316529/

You can find here model of car in two version
- first one is standard model that can use texture or vertex color and has second uv channel for lightmaps
- second one (with _AO affix) uses same techniques + has also baked AO in vertex color. It produces small artifacts but from distance it looks better

If you find this model cool, you found bugs, errors or want to share cool tip how to improve our work You
